**Data analysis using Python Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries:**
Used Pandas for data cleaning, filtering, grouping, and merging. 
Used Matplotlib and seaborn for creating visualizations, such as bar charts.

Performed the following steps as part of data analysis:

1. Import necessary libraries: Begin by importing the necessary libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 
2. Load the data: Load the data into a Pandas DataFrame, which allows you to manipulate and analyze the data easily. 
3. Data cleaning and pre-processing: Perform data cleaning and pre-processing steps, such as removing missing values, duplicates, and outliers, and converting data types as required. 
4. Data exploration and visualization: Use Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore the data and create visualizations to identify patterns and trends in the data. 
5. Statistical analysis: Conduct statistical analysis using Pandas and other statistical libraries to gain deeper insights into the data. 
6. Conclusion and reporting: Finally, summarize the findings and insights gained from the analysis and report the results in a clear and concise manner.
